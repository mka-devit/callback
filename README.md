The project I developed is a PHP web application for managing phone numbers. It automates working with blacklists, 
processes phone numbers, and provides a user-friendly interface. The main features include logging phone numbers, 
adding and removing numbers from lists, processing statistics, uploading text files, and working with number ranges. 
Administrators can configure parameters and templates for automated calls through a special panel, editing them via a web form.
